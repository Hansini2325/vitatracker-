Project Statement: VitaTracker
1. Problem Statement
In today's fast-paced world, maintaining a consistent health regimen is increasingly difficult. Many individuals struggle to keep track of their daily vitamin and medication intakes due to busy schedules, complex dosage requirements, and memory lapses.
Existing methods—such as mental notes, paper logs, or generic alarms—often fail to provide the necessary structure and historical data required to ensure adherence. Missing doses or accidentally doubling doses can reduce health benefits and, in some cases, pose health risks. There is a need for a centralized, digital solution that not only reminds users to take their supplements but also records their history to track consistency over time.
2. Scope of the Project
VitaTracker is a web-based application designed to digitize the management of personal health supplements. The scope of the project encompasses:
•	Web-Based Interface: A responsive web application accessible via browser.
•	Data Persistence: A relational database system to store user profiles, vitamin details, and long-term intake history.
•	Personalization: Individual user accounts ensuring data privacy and personalized schedules.
•	Logic & Automation: Algorithms to generate daily "to-do" lists based on user-defined frequency (daily, specific days) and times.
•	Analytics: Basic reporting tools to calculate adherence percentages and visualize intake trends over 30-day periods.
Note: The project focuses on self-reporting and tracking. It does not currently include hardware integration (smart pillboxes) or direct medical advice.
3. Target Users
The primary audience for VitaTracker includes:
•	Health-Conscious Individuals: People actively taking multivitamins, protein supplements, or fitness-related compounds who want to optimize their regimen.
•	Patients with Chronic Conditions: Individuals required to take specific medications at strict times daily.
•	Elderly Individuals & Caregivers: Users who need a simplified visual aid to remember complex pill schedules.
•	Pregnant Women: Individuals managing prenatal vitamins and supplements critical for maternal health.
•	Bio-hackers: Users interested in detailed data logging regarding their nutritional intake.
4. High-Level Features
User Management
•	Secure Authentication: Registration and login functionality to protect personal health data.
•	Profile Management: Ability to update personal details and settings.
Regimen Configuration
•	Vitamin Inventory: Users can add, edit, and delete vitamins from their personal database, including details like dosage and instructions.
•	Flexible Scheduling: Capability to set schedules based on specific times of day and days of the week (e.g., "Mon/Wed/Fri at 8:00 AM").
Daily Tracking Dashboard
•	Today’s View: A dynamic dashboard displaying only the items due for the current day.
•	One-Click Logging: Simple interaction to mark items as "Taken" or "Missed" without page reloads.
•	Real-Time Status: Immediate visual cues (color changes) indicating the status of a dose.
Analytics & Reporting
